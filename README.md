# TidyTuesday
This is a repository for my #TidyTuesday contributions, including my visualisations and R code. #TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project focused on using R to wrangle, tidy and plot a new data set every week. Participants share code and charts on Twitter with the goal of getting feedback and exploring other’s work. 

All #TidyTuesday data is available at: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.

To date I have participated in:
