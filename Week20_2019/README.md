# Nobel Prize Winners.

This week I created a Shiny app to highlight the gender gap in Nobel Prize winners, 
including interactive line charts, bar charts and word clouds: https://kylie-foster.shinyapps.io/nobelprizes/. Note the app may take a few minutes to load.

The code is provided in 'app.R'.

Examples of charts from my Shiny app are shown below.
